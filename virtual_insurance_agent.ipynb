However, this is \\nnot because it is void, but because some required action has not been taken \\n(e.g. stamp duty not paid on a lease of land, marine  insur ance policy not \\nissued, etc.).  This defect can be remedied by carrying out the required \\naction, so that the contract becomes enforceable (e.g. by issuing a marine \\npolicy even after a loss has realised).  \\n \\nTurning to the elements of contract  themselves, legal textbooks are not \\nalways agreed just exactly how many elements should be  found with any one valid \\ncontract, but we shall consider six criteria here, as follows (remembering that we \\nneed not go into great detail):  \\n \\n(a) Offer : if no offer is made, obviously there can be no agreement between the \\ntwo or more parties.  In insurance, the offeror  may be the intending insured \\n(perhaps by completing and submitting to the insurer a proposal form (or \\napplication form)), or the insurer (perhaps as a counter -offer or in connection \\nwith a policy renewal ); all depends on intention as evidenced by facts.   \\nTherefore, although it is widely accepted that an act of completing a n \\ninsurance proposal form is normally an act of offer, it is technically incorrect \\nto say that it is a settled law that completing an insurance proposal form is \\nan act of offer to the insurer.  \\n \\n(b) Acceptance:  the proposed contract cannot come into being unless the offer \\nis accepted by the other party (the offeree ).  All terms of the off er must be \\naccepted before a contract is concluded.  If th at other party intends to vary \\nthe terms of the proposed contract (requiring increased premium or policy \\nrestrictions, for example), this, upon its communication, constitutes a \\ncounter -offer, which will have the effect of nullifying the original offer. A \\ncounter -offer is subject to acceptance by the original offeror  (who becomes \\nthe offeree  with the counter offer).  \\n \\n(c) Consideration : this is the price (monetary or otherwise) a contracting party \\npays for the promise the other party (‘promisor ’) makes to him. In the case \\nof a simple contract, consideration must be given by both parties; otherwise \\nit is void.  On the other hand, a promise contained in a deed, even if it has \\nbeen given not for consideration, is enforceable at common law by the \\npromisee.  In other words, a unilateral promise not made by a deed is invalid. \\nIn insura nce, the consideration is:  \\n \\n(i) the promise  by the insured to pay premium; and  \\n \\n(ii) the promise  by the insurer to pay or compensate as per policy terms.  \\n \\nNote : 1 Where an insured event occurs before the premium promised  \\nis paid, the insured will still be entitled to insurance payment in \\naccordance with the terms of the contract and the insurer will have a \\nseparate claim against him for the unpaid premium. However, some \\npolicies require actual payment of premium as considerat ion, which \\nrequirement  will have the effect of overriding the said legal rule.  \\n ')"
